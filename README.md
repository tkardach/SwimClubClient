# Saratoga Swim Club Reservations
This is the front-end for the Covid-19 reservation system I made for the Saratoga Swim Club to enforce social distancing compliance.

'reservation-system' is the original front-end, which was used for most of the pandemic.
'client' is the updated client interface written in Angular, which was only used in production for a short month or two.

See [SwimClubServer](https://github.com/tkardach/SwimClubServer) for back-end implementation.
